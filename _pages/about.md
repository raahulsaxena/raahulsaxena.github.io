Hi! I am Rahul.

I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with a strong focus on Machine Learning, NLP, and AI Systems.

I have 4+ years of industry experience as a Software Engineer at Philips, where I worked on large-scale analytics applications.

Currently, I'm working as a Graduate Student Researcher at Spotify doing research on improving the performance of small language models on text-to-sql task.

I'm actively seeking full-time Software Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer opportunities. If you're a recruiter or a hiring manager, feel free to contact me to discuss new opportunities.
