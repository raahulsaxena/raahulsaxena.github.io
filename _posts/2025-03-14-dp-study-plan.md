## Pattern 1: 0/1 Knapsack (Bounded)


Solution is built upon subset, but with few more restrictions. For example you want to complete some courses, they have some reward points associated. But you can attend only k number of courses. Now try to maximize your points. This type of problems are just an extension to simple DP, where you add one more dimension to consider provided restriction.

### Problems:

- [Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/)
- [Last Stone Weight II](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/)
- [Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)

## Pattern 2: 0/1 Knapsack (Unbounded)


Dp state is similar to the classical knapsack problem.

### Problems:

- [Coin Change I](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/)
- [Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/description/)

## Pattern 3: Fibonacci (or Linear DP)


You just need to find the repetitive part of the solution and improve it by saving its result.

Dp solution requires us to solve the sub problem on every prefix of the array. A prefix of the array is a subarray from 0 to i for some i.
